    "### Collaborative Filtering systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will create a recommendation system for **restaurants** using [collaborative filtering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) (CF). The general structure of a recommendation system is that there are users and there are items. Users express explicit or implicit preferences towards certain items. CF thus relies on users' past behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary approaches to CF: neighboorhood and latent factor model. The former is concerned with computing the relationships between items or between users. In the latter approach you have a model of hidden factors through which users and items are transformed to the same space. For example, if you are rating movies we may transform items into genre factors, and users into their preference for a particular genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factor models generally lead to more accurate recommenders. One of the reasons for this is the sparsity of the item-user matrix. Most users tend to rate barely one or two items. Latent factor models are more expressive, and fit fewer parameters. However, neighborhood models are more prevalent, as they have an intuitive aspect that appeals to users(if you liked this you will like that) and online(a new preference can be incorporated very quickly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most recommenders today combine neighboorhood CF with model based CF, and SVD based matrix factorization approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the example of a simple beer recommender, go [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/20a18d52c539b87de2af). This homework is inspired by the one there but we go after food instead, and go deeper into the problem of making recommendations."

    "### User and Item based approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Original approaches to neighborhood based CF used user-user models. By this we mean that rating estimates are made from recorded ratings of like minded users. However, since most users tend to rate very few items, this is usually a losing proposition for explicit-rating based recommenders. Thus, most neighborhood based systems such as Amazon these days rely on item-item approaches. In these methods, a rating is estimated by other ratings made by the user on \"similar\" or \"nearby\" items: we have a K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm, in effect."

    "\n",
    "1. Create a database of item-item similarities. Use this to implement a neighborhood-based CF recommender that can answer simple questions like \"give me more restaurants like this one\". This part of the homework assumes that the similaties calculated make good \"global recommendations\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the second part, we go one step further and attempt to predict the rating that a user will give an item they have not seen before. This requires that we find the restaurants that *this* user would rate as similar (not just those which are globally similar). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the third part, we implement a factor-based CF recommender using a Bayesian model. While quite a bit more complex, this allows us to pool information both about similar users and about similar restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We will scale up our system by creating a recommender on the lines of Q1 and Q2 that works on the entire data set. We will use the map-reduce paradigm to split the computation over multiple machines."

    "\n",
    "To motivate our recommendation system, consider the follwing example. Let's pretend we are in Boston for a second. Lets say the average rating of restaurants here by all the users is 3.5. Sandrine's at Harvard square is better than an average restaurant, so it tends to be rated 0.5 stars above the average (over all the users). However, you are a curmudgeon, who tends to rate 0.2 stars below the average. Then a baseline estimate for the recommendation for Sandrine's, for you, is 3.5+0.5-0.2=3.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "These baseline estimates thus adjust the data by accounting for the systematic tendencies for some users who give higher ratings than others, and for some restaurants to recieve higher ratings than others. We can write the baseline estimate $\\hat Y_{um}^{baseline}$ for an unknown rating $Y_{um}$ for user $u$ and restaurant or business $m$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat Y_{um}^{baseline} = \\hat \\mu + \\hat \\theta_{u0} + \\hat \\gamma_{m0} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the $\\theta_{u0}$ and $\\gamma_{m0}$ are parameters which need to be fit. The simplest thing to start with, and something we will do for Problems 1 and 2 (but not 3), is to replace them by their \"mean\" estimates from the data. Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat Y^{baseline}_{um} = \\bar Y + (\\bar Y_u - \\bar Y) + (\\bar Y_m - \\bar Y)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The final two terms correspond to the user-specific and item-specific bias in ratings, that is, how their ratings tend to systematically diverge from the global average. This is the simplest possible way to predict a rating, based only on information about *this* user and *this* restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we do a better job of predicting the rating $Y_{um}$ user $u$ would give to restaurant $r$? According to the central dogma of CF, we ought to be able to use the responses of *similar* users regarding *similar* restaurants to get a better prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make an estimate of $Y_{um}$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{Y_{um}} = \\hat Y_{um}^{baseline}\\, + \\,\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{j \\in S^{k}(m)} s_{mj} ( Y_{uj} - \\hat Y_{uj}^{baseline} )}{\\sum\\limits_{j \\in S^{k}(m)} s_{mj} } $$\n",

    "\n",
    "In the next two problems, we will focus on using similar restaurants, or the item neighborhood.\n",
    "To do this, we compute a *similarity measure* $s_{mj}$ between the $m$th and $j$th items. This similarity might be measured via [cosine similarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), [pearson co-efficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient) or using other distance based measures. Here we shall use the Pearson coefficient. This measures the tendency of users to rate items similarly. Since most ratings are unknown, it is computed on the \"common user support\" (`n_common`), which is the set of common raters of both items. \n",
    "\n",

We call this a \"global\" recommender because it assumes that every user perceives the similarity between restaurants in the same way. Later on, we will implement a more specific recommender that pools information based on which items seem the most similar *to this user*.\n",

Based on the training set, I am recommended restaurant B. Now, I have rated B, but that information is in the testing set. I have no way of comparing the rating I give B in the testing set, to the similarity computed from the training set that was used to make the recomendation. The best I could do is to compare the average rating of restaurant B in the training set to my rating of restaurant B in the test set. \n",

To do this, we will try to personalize the information we use even further, and only pool information from restaurants that the user has rated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to return to the original problem of prediction $Y_{um}$ for a restaurant $m$ that user $u$ has never rated before. Using our newly computed similarity metrics, we can modify our original baseline estimate by pulling in information from the user's neighborhood of the restaurant $m$, and predict $Y_{um}$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{Y_{um}} = \\hat Y^{baseline}_{um}\\, + \\,\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{j \\in S^{k}(m;u)} s_{mj} ( Y_{uj} - \\hat Y^{baseline}_{uj} )}{\\sum\\limits_{j \\in S^{k}(m;u)} s_{mj} } $$\n",

However, one must start somewhere!\n",

    "### Model-Based Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Note on Frequentist and Bayesian Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we implemented a **procedure** (a set of instructions for processing data) for giving recommendations and predicting user ratings for restaurants. This procedure involved a number of arbitrary choices -- for example, the particular measure of similarity between restaurants, or the weighting scheme for constructing a predicted rating. It also gave no sense of uncertainty -- in the case of giving recommendations, there was no statement about how we would expect the ranking from the procedure to compare to the user's true opinions of restaurants, and in the case of predicting ratings, there was no confidence interval for the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible in repeated applications of the above procedure to see how it performs in the long run. Based on this long-run performance we could potentially justify certain functional choices and compute measurements of uncertainty. This framework of proposing a procedure first, then evaluating its performance in real or hypothetical replications of the experiment is an example of a *frequentist* approach to a problem. One aspect of the frequentist approach is that the proposed procedure does not necessarily have to be derived from a model (although it often is). While this means that a proposed procedure may be more flexible or robust than a model-based procedure, it also means that there is no natural way to justify certain functional choices or construct uncertainty estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the *Bayesian* approach to a problem always begins with a **probablistic model** for how the data were generated. Assuming this model is true, the posterior distribution over unknown quantities (either parameters to be estimated or unobserved data to be predicted) gives a single coherent expression of what the observed data tell us about the unknowns. By summarizing the posterior distribution, we can derive the exact functional form of a procedure for constructing estimates or predictions. We call a procedure derived from this Bayesian approach a **Bayes rule** (not to be confused with Bayes' Theorem). Using the posterior distribution, we can also give a sense of how uncertain we are about the estimate or prediction we have constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outline for this Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we construct a **model** of how ratings are generated, and use this model to build a recommendation and ratings prediction system. We will take a Bayesian approach here, and construct our estimates and predictions from summaries of the *posterior distribution* of the model's parameters, which we will compute using a *Gibbs sampler*. We will also give measures of uncertainty based on the posterior distribution. We will evaluate predictions from this approach in the same way we evalutated predictions from the KNN procedure above."

    "### The Latent Factor Model ###\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Overview ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The central dogma in constructing a recommendation system using collaborative filtering is that *similar users will rate similar restaurants similarly*. In the previous section, we explicitly encoded this idea by using a similarity function to identify similar restaurants. We also assumed that either all users were the same (the global approach) or that only the current user was similar enough to make a recommendation (the user-specific approach). In this section, we will use a model that allows us to identify both similar users and similar restaurants as a function of **latent factors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of latent factors as properties of restaurants (e.g., spiciness of food or price) that users have a positive or negative preference for. We do not observe these factors or the users' preferences directly, but we assume that they affect how users tend to rate restaurants. For example, if a restaurant serves a lot of spicy food and a user dislikes spicy food, then the restaurant would have a high \"spiciness\" factor, and the user would have a strongly negative preference, resulting in a prediction of a low rating. Note that if users have similar preferences, then according to the model, they will behave similarly, and likewise, if restaurants have similar latent factors, they will be rated similarly by similar users. Latent factors thus give us an intuitive way to specify a generative model the obeys the central dogma.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue that comes up with latent factor models is determining how many latent factors to include. There may be a number of different unmeasured properties that affect ratings in different ways -- for example, in addition to the spiciness factor above, there may also be a price factor that affects how users rate a restaurant. We deal with the problem of choosing the number of latent factors to include in the same way we deal with choosing $K$ in a $K$-nearest neighbors problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rating Model Specification ####\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this model concrete, we can write down our probability model as a generative process. First, we define the following quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $L$: The number of latent factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $U$: The number of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $M$: The number of items (restaurants).\n",
    "\n",
    "* $N$: The number of observed ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $Y_{um}$: The star rating given to restaurant $m$ by user $u$.\n",
    "* $Y$: The full collection of observed star ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Item-specific quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\gamma_m$: An item-specific parameter vector of length $L+1$. The first element of $\\gamma_m$, denoted $\\gamma_m[0]$ is the item-specific bias. The remaining $L$ elements of $\\gamma_m$, denoted $\\gamma_m[1:]$, are the latent factors associated with item $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\Gamma$: An $M$ by $L+1$ matrix where the $m$th row is $\\gamma_m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-specific quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\theta_u$: A user-specific parameter vector of length $L+1$. The first element of $\\theta_u$, denoted $\\theta_u[0]$ is the user-specific bias. The remaining $L$ elements of $\\theta_u$, denoted $\\theta_u[1:]$, are user $u$'s preferences for the latent factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\Theta$: A $U$ by $L+1$ matrix where the $u$th row is $\\theta_u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mu$: The overall ratings mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\sigma$: The residual variance of ratings after the mean, bias terms, and latent factors have been taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these quantities, we can specify our model for each rating $Y_{um}$ similarly to a linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_{um} = \\mu + \\theta_{u}[0] + \\gamma_{m}[0] + \\theta_{u}[1:]^{\\top}\\gamma_{m}[1:] + \\epsilon_{um}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon_{um} \\sim N(0, \\sigma).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while this looks like a linear regression, it is of a slightly different form because the latent factor term involves the product of two unknowns. This is like a linear regression where we forgot to measure some covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assume the following priors on the user-specific and item-specific parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\gamma_m &\\sim MVN(\\mathbf 0, \\Lambda_\\gamma^{-1})\\\\\n",
    "\\theta_u &\\sim MVN(\\mathbf 0, \\Lambda_\\theta^{-1}),\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $MVN$ means multivariate normal, $\\mathbf 0$ is vector of length $L+1$ filled with zeros, and $\\Lambda_\\theta^{-1}$ and $\\Lambda_\\gamma^{-1}$ are $L+1 \\times L+1$ covariance matrices. $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ also have priors, but they are not relevant to your task so we won't write them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal for this Model ####\n",
    "Using this model, we want to make inference about all of the quantities that, if we knew them, would allow us to sample $Y_{um}$ for any user and any item. These quantities are $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, and the elements of $\\Theta$ and $\\Gamma$."

    "### Gibbs Sampling from the Posterior ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to compute the **posterior distribution** over the unknowns $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, $\\Gamma$, and $\\Theta$ given $Y$, which reflects how much we know about these quantities given the data we have observed. We write this distribution as $P(\\mu, \\sigma, \\Gamma, \\Theta \\mid Y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most general way to learn about the posterior distribution is to sample from it. This can be challenging, particularly in problems that are very high dimensional (see your answer to the question above). One strategy for for sampling from high-dimensional distributions is **Gibbs sampling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gibbs sampling breaks down the posterior probability distribution into blocks of unknowns, and samples iteratively from each block assuming that the values of the other blocks (and the data) are known and fixed. In this case, we will break down the posterior distribution into blocks of $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, each vector $\\gamma_m$, and each vector $\\theta_u$. We have already implemented the draws for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. You will need to implement the draws for each $\\gamma_m$ and each $\\theta_u$. Luckily, the structures of these draws are similar, so you will only need to implement two functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll derive the form of the draws below. Note that you don't need to be able to follow these derivations fully -- you'll just need to be able to use the result at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distribution of $\\gamma_{m'}$ given $Y, \\mu, \\sigma, \\Gamma_{-m'}, \\Theta$ ####\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this is the distribution of the item-specific parameters for item $m'$, imagining that all of the other unknowns are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, we want to draw from the distribution of $\\gamma_{m'}$ conditional on the data $Y$ and all other unknowns -- that is, $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, all of $\\Theta$, and all of $\\Gamma$ except for $\\gamma_{m'}$, which we denote $\\Gamma_{-m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the model specification above, the only places that $\\gamma_{m'}$ appears are in the regression equations for each $Y_{um}$ that involves item $m'$. If we write out just these equations, we get a system of the following form,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_{um'} = \\mu + \\theta_{u}[0] + \\gamma_{m'}[0] + \\theta_{u}[1:]^{\\top}\\gamma_{m'}[1:] + \\epsilon_{um'},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with one equation for each $u$ that rated item $m'$. Now, because \n",
    "\n",
    "If we move all of the fully known terms to the left-hand side, we obtain the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_{um'} - \\mu - \\theta_{u}[0] = \\gamma_{m'}[0] + \\theta_{u}[1:]^{\\top}\\gamma_{m'}[1:] + \\epsilon_{um'}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, because we assume that $\\theta_{u}$ is known, this equation now fits cleanly into the form of a linear regression, where $\\gamma_{m'}$ is the vector of unknown coefficients. This means that the posterior distribution for $\\gamma_{m'}$ conditional on everything else is the same as the posterior for the coefficients of a Bayesian linear regression of $(Y_{um'} - \\mu - \\theta_{u}[0])$ on $\\theta_{u}[1:]$ and an intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the set of users who rated item $m'$ as $(u_1, \\cdots, u_g)$. Then, we can define the following vector and matrix:\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "X_{m'} &= \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \\theta_{u_1}[1:]^\\top \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & \\theta_{u_g}[1:]^\\top\\end{array}\\right),\n",

    "All mrjob tasks use the map-reduce strategy to divide up computation across computers. You should work through the mrjob tutorial to gain familiarity with this, but we’ll also outline the basic process here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. During the first map step, mrjob calls a mapper function with a key (which for the first step is None), and a value (which for the first step is a line of data from an input file). This function does whatever it wants with this data, and yields a key and value.  The key is used in step 2 to gather up the values from all the different mappers into groups\n",
    "\n",
    "2. mrjob collects the outputs from all the mappers, and gathers them into subsets with the same key value (this is similar to what pandas.groupby does). It passes each of these subsets to a reducer (or “collector”) function, whose job is to synthesize this list of grouped data into something useful (e.g., computing the mean of all the inputs). It then yields the key and reduced value. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If there are any additional steps, mrjob feeds each output from a reducer function in step 2 to the next mapper. Otherwise, it prints the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point behind map-reduce is to agree upon a common framework to split up a large computational job into smaller tasks. mrjob then has a lot of freedom to organize how these tasks run in parallel, on many machines"

It dosent do anything with the `user_id`, however, it takes every combination (thus len(list) choose 2) of 2 `business_id`s from the passed on list (see combinations in itertools in the python documentation) and sends on the remaining information keyed on the tuple `(restaurant1, restaurant2)`. Be sure to handle the case where the restaurant id's are flipped: include them somehow under the same key.\n",

This sort of collection is key to this style of programming. This list information should now correspond to all the common support of the two restaurants. Use this information to calculate this common support and the pearson similarity. Return the aforementioned tuple by yielding it keyed by the tuple of restaurants. This information will be sent to the output file. The output keys and values will both be in JSON format, separated by a tab.\n",

Do **NOT** include the data file `output.full.emr.txt` from the larger run (its huge, so we will check your answers to 4.4 instead).
